User Registration – Uniqueness Validation (Critical Fix)

While registering a new user, the system currently allows account creation even if the email ID or mobile number already exists.

Expected Behavior:

Email ID must be unique

Mobile number must be unique

If either the email ID or mobile number already exists in the database, the system should:

Block registration

Show a clear validation message (e.g., “Email or mobile number already registered”)

This validation must apply to:

Email + Password registration

Email + Mobile Number registration

Duplicate accounts must not be created under any condition.

2️⃣ Referral-Based Registration – UI & Logic Fix

Currently, when a user registers via a referral link:

The referral code input box is missing

Referral commission details are not properly reflected

Expected Behavior:

Referral code should be auto-applied when a user lands via a referral link.

The referral code must be visible (read-only) in the “Create Account” section.

On successful registration via referral:

Referral mapping must be stored correctly.

Commission structure should be applied automatically.

3️⃣ Referral Commission Visibility (User Dashboard)

Users who joined via a referral should be able to see:

Referral commission details in their dashboard

Commission percentage / tier details clearly

This should be a fully functional and stable module, not just static UI.

4️⃣ Color-wise Stock Management (New Enhancement)

Add color-wise inventory management for products.

Expected Behavior:

Each product color variant should have its own stock quantity.

Example:

Red → 10 units

Blue → 5 units

Black → 0 units (Out of Stock)

Stock should:

Reduce based on purchase of that specific color

Reflect correct availability on frontend

This should work independently from size-based inventory (if size inventory exists).

5️⃣ Referral Tracking – Influencer / Referrer Stats (Critical Feature)

For users who share referral links:

The “My Stats” / Influencer Dashboard must show:

Total users joined via their referral link

Clear count of successful sign-ups

Expected Behavior:

Every new user who joins using a referral link should be:

Linked to the referrer

Counted accurately in referrer’s stats

Real-time or near real-time update in:

“My Stats”

Referral summary section
